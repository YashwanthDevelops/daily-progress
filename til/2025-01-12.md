## New Challenge: 30 Days of Speaking

### Why

I'm bad at speaking English.

Not grammar. Not vocabulary. The actual speaking part.

- Confidence drops when camera is on
- Words don't flow naturally
- Accent feels like a barrier

### The Fix

30 days. Instagram. Public videos.

Day 1 posted today.

### The Fear

Before posting:
- "What if people judge my English?"
- "What if I sound stupid?"
- "What if nobody cares?"

After posting:
- Still alive
- Nothing bad happened
- Feel slightly proud

**Lesson:** The fear of posting is always worse than the posting.
