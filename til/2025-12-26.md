## Inheritance

Child class inherits attributes and methods from parent class.

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name)  # Call parent constructor
        self.breed = breed
    
    def speak(self):  # Override parent method
        return "Woof!"

dog = Dog("Max", "Labrador")
print(dog.name)    # Max (inherited)
print(dog.breed)   # Labrador (own attribute)
print(dog.speak()) # Woof! (overridden)

# Reading a file
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()        # Entire file as string
    # or
    lines = file.readlines()     # List of lines

# Writing to a file
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!\n")
    file.writelines(["Line 1\n", "Line 2\n"])

# Appending to a file
with open("log.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("New log entry\n")
