**What BlindPost does:**
- Analyzes your thinking/writing
- Identifies cognitive blind spots
- Helps you see what you're missing
- Enables clearer decision-making

**What I built:**
- ~80% complete
- Core logic working
- Main features functional

**What happened:**
- Ran out of time
- Deadline passed
- Couldn't submit

**The irony:**
A tool about identifying blind spots. My blind spot? Time management.
