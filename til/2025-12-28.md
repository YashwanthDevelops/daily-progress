## Big Update: Microsoft Imagine Cup 2025

Applied today. Next 12 days focused on building a real project for the competition.

LeetCode is paused, not abandoned. Will resume after submission.

**Why this matters:**
- Real project > practice problems (for now)
- Competition experience on resume
- Deadline creates focus
- Building > grinding when energy is recovering
