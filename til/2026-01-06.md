## What I Did Today

### Hostel Setup
- Unpacked everything
- Organized room
- Planned diet for the semester
- Got back into routine mode

### Figma Brush-Up

Already knew Figma from before. Today was about:
- Remembering shortcuts
- Practicing basic layouts
- Getting comfortable with the tool again

---

## Figma Quick Reference

### Keyboard Shortcuts I Refreshed

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Frame | F |
| Rectangle | R |
| Text | T |
| Hand tool | H / Space + drag |
| Zoom in/out | Cmd/Ctrl + scroll |
| Duplicate | Cmd/Ctrl + D |
| Group | Cmd/Ctrl + G |
| Component | Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + K |
| Auto layout | Shift + A |

### Basic Design Concepts Practiced

- Frame hierarchy (pages → frames → elements)
- Auto layout for responsive components
- Component creation and instances
- Basic typography hierarchy
- Spacing and alignment

## The "AI Will Kill Design" Take

18 months ago: "AI will make designers obsolete in a year."

Today: Figma is still industry standard. Designers still employed.

### What AI Actually Does:
- Generates variations quickly
- Speeds up mockup creation
- Provides starting points

### What AI Doesn't Do:
- Understand user context
- Make taste-based decisions
- Handle client communication
- Know when rules should be broken

### My Take:

AI automates production. Not taste.

The gap between "AI-generated" and "actually good" design is still massive.

Knowing design fundamentals = still valuable.

## Why Figma Matters for Backend

Even as a Backend + AI engineer, design knowledge helps:

- Better collaboration with frontend/design team
- Ability to prototype ideas quickly
- Understanding user-facing implications of API decisions
- Building side projects that don't look terrible

Full-stack thinking includes design thinking.

## Reflection

**What went well:**
- Settled into hostel
- Maintained streak creatively (Figma counts as learning)
- Energy is solid at 8/10

**What I'm thinking:**
- Need to get back to LeetCode tomorrow
- College schedule starts properly soon
- Time to establish the semester routine

**On keeping multiple skills sharp:**

The 420-day journey is about Backend + AI.

But design, communication, planning — these compound too.

Today was a "side skill maintenance" day. Still counts.

## Progress

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Day | 15/420 |
| LeetCode Solved | 10 (no change) |
| Energy | 8/10 |
| Streak | 15 days ✓ |
| Location | College hostel |
| Status | Settled + refreshed |

---

## Tomorrow's Plan

- College classes (check schedule)
- LeetCode — at least 2 problems (no more delays)
- Establish daily routine
- Find consistent time blocks for learning
