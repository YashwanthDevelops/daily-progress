## Why This Entry Exists

Not every day has learnings to document.

Some days are just logistics.

But the streak continues. Day 14 logged.

The 420-day journey isn't just about the coding days. It's about all the days.

## Semester 4 Begins

Back at college. Hostel room. Fresh semester.

**What's ahead:**
- College classes resume
- New subjects
- Balancing coursework + 420-day journey
- Getting back to LeetCode
- Finding time blocks for learning

**The break recap (Days 1-13):**
- LeetCode: 10 problems
- Projects: 3 (NeuroNav, Vibeathon entry, Construction website)
- Hackathons: 2 submitted
- Freelance: First client, first payout
- Python: Fundamentals → OOP → File handling

Not a bad foundation to start the semester on.

## Reflection

**Physical state:** Exhausted. Zero sleep travel is brutal.

**Mental state:** Surprisingly okay. 6/10.

**What I'm thinking:**
- Need to establish a college routine quickly
- LeetCode has been paused too long
- Time management is now critical
- Rest tonight is mandatory
