## What I Built: NeuroNav

A face recognition system that helps identify potential ADHD indicators in students.

### The Problem

- ADHD often goes undetected in classroom settings
- Teachers manage 30+ students, can't track behavioral patterns individually
- Early detection leads to better outcomes
- Current screening methods are slow or inaccessible

### The Solution

NeuroNav acts as a screening assistant (not a diagnostic tool):

1. **Face Recognition** — Identifies individual students
2. **Behavioral Analysis** — Tracks visual cues and patterns
3. **Pattern Detection** — Monitors changes over time
4. **Flagging System** — Alerts teachers to students who might need professional evaluation
