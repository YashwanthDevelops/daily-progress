## The AI Ideation Experiment

### What I Tried

Spent hours asking Claude Opus for project ideas.

**Prompts attempted:**
- "Give me hackathon ideas for students"
- "Unique project ideas for Imagine Cup"
- "Problems that college students face"
- "Ideas that would impress judges"
- "Innovative AI/ML project ideas"

**What I got:**
- Study planner apps
- Expense trackers
- Mental health chatbots
- To-do list variations
- "Personalized learning platforms"

All generic. All exist. All solving imaginary problems.

### What Actually Worked

Closed the AI. Asked myself:

1. What annoys me daily?
2. What do I complain about to friends?
3. What's broken in my actual life?
4. What makes me say "why does this suck?"

3 solid ideas in 10 minutes.
