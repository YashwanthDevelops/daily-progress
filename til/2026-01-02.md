## What Happened

College course timetable registration day.

The system where you book your own schedule for the semester.

### Timeline

- Spent hours on the registration portal
- Server issues, slow loading, high traffic
- Finally got my timetable locked in
- Felt accomplished

Then:

> "Due to issues faced by some students, final registration will be re-run tomorrow."

Entire day potentially wasted.

## The Reality of Building While Studying

The 420-day journey assumes I control my time.

I don't.

I'm a 2nd year CS student. Things like:
- Course registration
- Exams
- Assignments
- College bureaucracy

...don't pause because I have a LeetCode streak going.

Some days, life takes the day.

This was one of those days.

## Reflection

**What's frustrating:**
- Zero coding done
- Registration might need to be redone
- Feels like wasted time

**What's true:**
- This is part of being a student
- Can't build a career while failing college
- One lost day doesn't break 420

**Mindset:**
- Don't romanticize the grind
- Life will interrupt
- The streak is about consistency over months, not perfection every day
