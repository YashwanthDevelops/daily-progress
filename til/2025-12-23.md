- **Total:** 2/450
- **Problems:**
  - ✅ Two Sum (Easy) - HashMap
  - ✅ Valid Parentheses (Easy) - Stack

## What I Learned

### Python Basics
- Lists are mutable, tuples are immutable
- Sets for unique elements, O(1) lookup
- Dictionaries for key-value pairs (like Java HashMap)

```python
# Quick reference
my_list = [1, 2, 3]        # Mutable, ordered
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)       # Immutable, ordered
my_set = {1, 2, 3}         # Mutable, unordered, unique
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2} # Key-value pairs
