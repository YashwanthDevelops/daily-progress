## New Project: Aadhar Integration

**Status:** Started

**What I can share:**
- Involves Aadhar card / identity verification
- Solves a problem I've personally experienced
- Fits into the Backend + AI stack I'm learning

**What I can't share yet:**
- Specific problem being solved
- Full feature scope
- Target users

More details as the project develops.

## Week Planning

Mapped out the entire next week:

| Time Block | Activity |
|------------|----------|
| Morning (before class) | LeetCode / Learning |
| Class hours | Survival mode |
| After class | Project work |
| Evening | Review / Content |
| Weekend | Deep work on project |

**Why this matters:**

If I don't protect my time, classes will eat all of it.

Proactive scheduling > Reactive scrambling.

## The College Realization

Spent hours in lectures today.

Learned nothing new.

**The uncomfortable truth:**

| What college teaches | What building teaches |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Pass exams | Solve problems |
| Follow syllabus | Follow curiosity |
| Memorize concepts | Apply concepts |
| Templates everyone uses | Unique projects |
| 3-year-old curriculum | Current tech |

**My approach:**

→ Show up (need the degree)
→ Do minimum required
→ Invest real energy in self-learning
→ Build actual projects

Not dropping out. Just not expecting college to make me employable.

That's my job.

## Reflection

**What went well:**
- Started Aadhar project
- Week is planned
- Clarity on what college provides (and doesn't)
- Energy stable at 8/10

**What didn't go well:**

LeetCode skipped again.

Yesterday: Solved 1 problem after 8-day gap.
Today: Back to 0.

The restart didn't stick yet.

**Honest assessment:**

The project feels more exciting than LeetCode right now.

But the target is 450+ problems. Can't ignore it.

Need to find a way to make LeetCode non-negotiable, even on class-heavy days.

Maybe: 1 problem before first class. No excuses.
