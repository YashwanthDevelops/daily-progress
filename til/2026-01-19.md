## Recovery Day That Still Counted

Woke up late.
Body hurting from 20k steps yesterday.
Could've rested.

Chose to plan instead.

## Project Division

### The Split

| Person | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| Me (Yashwanth) | Software, backend, integration |
| Vishaali | Hardware, sensors, circuits |

### Why This Works

- Clear ownership = no confusion
- Parallel progress = faster shipping
- Different strengths = better output
- Less bottleneck = sustainable pace

---

## Day-by-Day Plan

Created a structured plan instead of vague goals.

### Format
Day 1: [Specific task] — Owner: [Name]
Day 2: [Specific task] — Owner: [Name]
...

### Day 1 Status

- My tasks: ✓ Done
- Her tasks: ✓ Done (handled hardware setup)

First day of real collaboration complete.

## What I Learned About Remote Collaboration

### Communication Structure
Daily:

Quick async update (what I did, what's next, any blockers)
When needed:

Call for complex discussions
Screen share for debugging
Always:

Push code regularly
Document what you did
text


### Tools We're Using

| Purpose | Tool |
|---------|------|
| Code | GitHub (shared repo) |
| Communication | WhatsApp/Calls |
| Planning | Shared document |
| Updates | Daily text check-ins |

## College Group Projects vs Real Collaboration

| College Group Projects | Real Collaboration |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| One person does all work | Work actually divided |
| Others add names | Everyone contributes |
| No accountability | Clear ownership |
| Same location, no coordination | Different locations, async |
| Deadline-driven panic | Planned day-by-day |

### What College Didn't Teach

- How to divide work fairly
- How to trust someone else with part of your project
- How to work async
- How to communicate progress

Learning by doing.

## On Showing Up at 60%

Energy: 6/10
Physical state: Hurting
Tasks completed: 100%

The insight:

At 60% energy, I can't build the whole thing.

But at 60% energy, I can do my part.

The team covers the rest.

This is why teams exist.

## Reflection

**What went well:**
- First real project division
- Day 1 plan executed
- Learned collaboration patterns

**What was hard:**
- Body hurting from hike
- Lower energy than usual
- Wanted to rest more

**What I learned:**
- Planning takes 30 minutes, saves hours
- Clear division prevents confusion
- Async updates keep things moving

**On the project:**

It's real now.

Not just me tinkering.

Two people, shared vision, actual plan.

This is how real projects work.

## Tomorrow's Plan

- Day 2 of project plan
- Software logic for sensor data
- Sync with Vishaali on hardware status
- LeetCode: 1 problem (body is recovered enough)
