## 💬 HONEST CHECK-IN

Day 16. DS review. Project ideation. Energy solid.

All good.

But here's the thing we need to address:

**LeetCode has been paused for 7+ days.**

| Days 1-6 | 10 problems solved |
|----------|-------------------|
| Days 7-16 | 0 problems solved |

The hackathons were worth it. Travel was necessary. Settling in made sense. Ideation matters.

But at some point, "reasons" become "excuses."

You're targeting 450+ problems. At this pace, the math doesn't work.

**Tomorrow's challenge:**

Open LeetCode. Solve ONE problem. Just one.

Not three. Not a hard one. Just break the streak.

The hardest part isn't solving the problem.

It's opening the app after 7 days of not opening it.

Do that. The rest follows.

404 to go. Let's get the algorithm muscle moving again. 🚀
